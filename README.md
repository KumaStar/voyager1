Voyager 1

NASA’s space probe Voyager 1, launched in 1977 to study the outer planets, has gone missing in the abyss.
In this game, you are trapped inside this lifeless machine, with barely enough room for a computer. Your task is to use the terminal to search for signals drifting through the void and navigate toward them.
But be careful when you travel — the main navigation module isn’t working, and you can only move to new coordinates using the auto-guidance system.
And whatever you do… watch for anomalies in the spectrograms of those signals.

The theme of this game is cosmcic horror / lovecraftian / 2d / pre rendered image / audio
This game was made under 48 hours for spooky jam 25 <3
